# Student Performance Analysis (Regression Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a student dataset using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **regression modeling** to understand the key factors influencing academic performance.

---

## 📊 Dataset

* Student-related features such as study hours and practice behavior
* Target variable: academic performance
* Used for regression-based prediction

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature selection and correlation analysis
4. Regression model building
5. Model evaluation and interpretation

---

## ✅ Key Findings

* **Hours studied** and **sample paper practice** are strong predictors of student performance
* Clear positive relationship between study effort and academic success
* Regression model achieved good predictive accuracy

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

---

## 💼 Use Case

This analysis helps educators and institutions:

* Identify factors affecting student success
* Support data-driven academic planning
* Predict performance based on student behavior

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The project demonstrates how EDA and regression techniques can be used to analyze student data and predict academic outcomes, providing actionable insights for educational decision-making.
